# My Board Designs — PCB Portfolio

A curated collection of my PCB design work, showcasing multi-layer power systems, test/characterization carrier boards, mixed-signal routing, and professional schematic/layout methodology.

All content is fully anonymized and provided solely as a demonstration of design capability.

## 🌐 Repository Overview

This repository contains two complete hardware designs:

- A **4-layer multi-rail power board**  
- A **multi-module test/characterization carrier board**

Each folder includes schematics, 3D renders, routing screenshots, and stack-ups to highlight design decisions, layout quality, and engineering workflow.
