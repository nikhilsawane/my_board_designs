# ECEN 5730 — PCB Design Coursework Portfolio

This folder contains four hardware design projects completed for **ECEN 5730: High-Speed Digital Design / PCB Design** at the University of Colorado Boulder.  
Each board showcases a different set of PCB engineering skills, including layout fundamentals, switching noise mitigation, mixed-signal routing, microcontroller integration, and instrumentation circuitry.

All boards include schematics, layouts, 3D renders, and technical notes where applicable.
